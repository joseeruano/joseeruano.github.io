## What is this platform?
LeDon is a platform that helps businesses create a better shopping experience for their clients. Vendors with LeDon can create personalized online gift cards and certificates that customers can use throughout their websites (yourdomain.com) and retail locations. LeDon works as an interface in the purchase experience for brands and retailers. Companies would be able to add to their catalogues of products a gift card designed specific for their brand and their stores.

## Why LeDon?

There has been a lot of times we can't decide what to give to a special person, so we end up giving things that the receiver doesn't want or need, making us more anxious about gifts. 
We at LeDon believe that giving should be easy and fun, so we created a more accesible way of saying thank you to the people we love.

Also here's a little reason, courtesy of The Atlantic, about why people have a hard time giving gifts. We started LeDon cards to make a perfect solution for many reasons. 
Our mission is to make giving a simpler, safer and better way of life.
