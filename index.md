## Why LeDon?

There has been a lot of times we can't decide what to give to a special person, so we end up giving things that the receiver doesn't want or need, making us more anxious about gifts. 
We at LeDon believe that giving should be easy and fun, so we created a more accesible way of saying thank you to the people we love.

Also here's a little reason, courtesy of The Atlantic, about why people have a hard time giving gifts. We started LeDon cards to make a perfect solution for many reasons. 
Our mission is to make giving a simpler, safer and better way of life.
